Final project for the sage class
================================
Currently I am deciding what I want to code first. I have four different research projects for which some coding
would be useful and I plan to implement one of them. 
Possible titles: 

1. Billera-Lee polytopes and regularity of stacked triangulations
2. The combinatorial coalgebra of PS-ear decomposable complexes
3. Random polytopes approximating spheres: computational aspects. 
4. Unimodality of h-vectors of simplicial polytopes: dimensions 16-19.
