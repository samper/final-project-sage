Final project for the sage class
================================

This repository contains my final project for the special topics course about Sage. It will probably contain two documents.
One pdf file that introduces the problem, states a conjecture and explains some of the results obtained and a second file 
on sage that contains the code used to produce examples. This comes from a joint research project with Richard Robinson who 
is also helping with the programming. 

Briefly speaking, the goal of the project is (the precise definitions will be available soon in the pfd file): 

1. Write a function that returns a cyclic polytope of dimension d with n>d vertices (This is already implemented in the polyhedal class in sage)
2. Write a function that verifies wether a finite integer sequence is a Macaulay sequence. (Done in the worksheet Macualay sequence check)
3. Write a function that returns a line shelling of a polytope, given the polytope, an interior point and an (approximate) direction
4. Produce code that constructs a Billera-Lee polytope given a suitable g-vector.
5. Write a function that returns the r-stacked triangulation of a given polytope with g_r = 0
6. Given the combinatorial data of an r-stacked triangulation, write a function that writes the linear program that verifies stackedness of the triangulation
